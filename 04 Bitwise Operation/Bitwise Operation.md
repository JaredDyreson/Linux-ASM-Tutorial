# Bitwise Operation

Here we will start to play with the bits of the numbers we work with


## cover these topics

- add, or, xor
- endianess
- swappning ^ (include his program that will swap the bits
- checking if number is even by anding it with 1 and check the flag (check float program for more information)


## AND

## OR

## XOR

## Swapping Endianess

## Even or Odd?
